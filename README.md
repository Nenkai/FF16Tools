# FF16Tools

Tools & Library for games created using the Final Fantasy XVI / 16 Engine:

* FINAL FANTASY XVI
* FINAL FANTASY TACTICS - The Ivalice Chronicles (mod loader in progress.)

### Features

* `.pac` Unpacker/Repacker
* `.tex` to `.dds` conversion
* `.dds` & other image formats to `.tex`
* `.nxd` (Nex/Next ExcelDB) conversion (currently only FFXVI. Please contribute layouts for any other games)
* `.pzd` (Panzer Files aka Dialogue Lines) files conversion
* Save file (`.png`) unpack/pack (from: `Documents\My Games\FINAL FANTASY XVI\Steam\<steam_id>`)
* FlatBuffer schemas for `.kdb` (KineDriver) & `.bnmb` (Bonamik) files

This hasbeen tested on Final Fantasy 16 (Steam/PC) files.

## Usage

Get the latest version in [**Releases**](https://github.com/Nenkai/FF16Pack/releases).

### Pac File
You can use the **GUI/Graphical version**, or for the command line (CLI) commands:

* Unpacking all files from a pack: `FF16Tools.CLI unpack-all -i <path_to_pac> [-o <output_directory>] [-g <gametype>]`
* Unpacking a specific file from a specific pack: `FF16Tools.CLI unpack -i <path_to_pac> -f <game_file> [-o <output_directory>] [-g <gametype>]`
* Unpacking all packs: `FF16Tools.CLI unpack-all-packs -i <path_to_folder_with_packs> [-o <output_directory>] [-g <gametype>]`
* Pack a directory into a `.pac`: `FF16Tools.CLI pack -i <path_to_directory> [-o <output_directory>] [-g <gametype>]`
* Listing files: `FF16Tools.CLI list-files -i <path_to_pac> [-g <gametype>]`

> [!NOTE]
> You must supply the `-g` (or `--gametype` argument) for games other than FFXVI when unpacking or packing. Valid options are:
> * `ffxvi` for FINAL FANTASY XVI
> * `fft` for FINAL FANTASY TACTICS - The Ivalice Chronicles


### Textures
* Converting `.tex` to `.dds`: Drag-drop files/folders or `FF16Tools.CLI tex-conv -i <path>`
* Converting to `.tex`: Drag-drop files or `FF16Tools.CLI img-conv -i <path>`

> [!WARNING]  
> * 3D textures are not yet supported.

### Nex (NXD)

* To SQLite: `nxd-to-sqlite -i <path to directory> [-o output sqlite file] [-g <gametype>]`
* From SQLite: `sqlite-to-nxd -i <path to sqlite file> [-t <table_list_separated_by_spaces> -o <output_directory>] [-g <gametype>]`

> [!NOTE]
> * When converting from SQLite to Nex, you can provide a table list to avoid converting all the tables if not needed.
> * Use a SQLite database editor/viewer such as [SQLiteStudio](https://sqlitestudio.pl/).
> * Always check the [Changelog](NEX_CHANGELOG.md) for updated table column names.
> * Refer to the [table layouts here](FF16Tools.Files/Nex/Layouts) for the column value types. Note: this has been mapped mostly manually. Please contribute if something is amiss or you have figured out the column names.
> * Nex can contain nested data, therefore arrays and other structs are converted to json strings.
> * Nex can contain row sets that don't actually contain any rows. This information is lost between SQLite conversion, but should *hopefully* not matter.
> * You may need to edit `root.nxl` from `0001` to reflect the number of rows (if you've added/removed any).

## Modding

### Method 1: Automatic Mod Loader

Use [Reloaded-II](https://github.com/Reloaded-Project/Reloaded-II/releases) and install the mod loader for each game:
* [FINAL FANTASY XVI](https://www.nexusmods.com/finalfantasy16/mods/3) ([**Guide**](https://nenkai.github.io/ffxvi-modding/modding/creating_mods/))
* [FINAL FANTASY TACTICS - The Ivalice Chronicles](https://www.nexusmods.com/finalfantasytacticstheivalicechronicles/mods/4) ([**Guide**](https://nenkai.github.io/ffxvi-modding/modding/creating_mods_fft/))


### Method 2: Modding Manually

> [!WARNING]
> This guide is only for FINAL FANTASY XVI as it uses a different mechanism for sideloading packs.
> 
> You should use **Method 1** if you intend to distribute mods, otherwise it is not possible for users to install multiple mods that edits the same pack contents. **You should not be touching original game files!**

You may choose to rebuild a `.pac` entirely, or **preferably** you can use `.diff.pac` files.

When packing an extracted folder, the output pack file should have `.diff` in its name. The game will load this file.

So if your files came from `0000.pac`, the new pac file should be `0000.diff.pac`. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **You only have to include files you want to edit, not ALL the files from the original `.pac`**.
> 
> If the extracted archive had a `.path` file, it should be present when packing.
> 
> If you are editing any of the language files (like `0001.en.pac`), you should have `0001.diff.pac` AND `0001.diff.en.pac`. if you don't have the first one, the second one won't load. If you don't need to edit the first one, just copy it and rename it.

#### Extra Notes

Each pack file can contain a general embedded folder name. This is the case for `0001.pac`, or nested packs inside `0000.pac`.

For instance, `0001.pac` has `nxd` has its embedded folder name. Which means that every file in that pack is inside a folder named `nxd`. Example: `ability.nxd` becomes `nxd/ability.nxd` 

This can be tricky to handle, so the *unpacker* creates a `.path` file with the name of the folder.

The *packer* picks the path from this file accordingly. It can also be set manually with the `--name` argument, if needed.

## Acknowledgements

[Vortice.Windows](https://github.com/amerkoleci/Vortice.Windows) for having a usable DirectStorage wrapper/API.
* [GisDeflate](https://github.com/sk-zk/GisDeflate) would break on a certain file (also doesn't have span interfaces),
* [Silk.NET](https://github.com/dotnet/Silk.NET) has 0 documentation, and would return obtuse windows errors such as `0x8004001` (not implemented). Very useful!
